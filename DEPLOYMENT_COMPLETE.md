## Cost Optimization Tips
1. Services are set to 2 tasks each - can be reduced to 1 for development
2. RDS is using db.t3.micro - suitable for small to medium workloads
3. Consider using AWS Savings Plans for long-term cost reduction

## Support
For any issues:
1. Check CloudWatch logs first
2. Verify all services are running in ECS console
3. Ensure security groups allow proper communication
