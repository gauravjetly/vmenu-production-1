# ðŸš¨ URGENT: AWS Security Breach - Immediate Action Required

## What Happened
Your AWS credentials were exposed in a public file on GitHub. AWS automatically detected this and quarantined your account to prevent unauthorized access.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Delete the Exposed Credentials
```bash
# Delete the file with exposed credentials
cd /Users/gauravjetly/VMenu
rm GITHUB_SETUP_VINTIQ.md
rm GITHUB_SECRETS_GUIDE.md
rm DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md
rm GITHUB_SETUP_GAURAVJETLY.md
rm GITHUB_SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md

# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove files with exposed credentials"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deactivate Compromised Access Keys
1. Go to IAM: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
2. Click Users â†’ vmenu-admin
3. Go to "Security credentials" tab
4. Find access key: AKIA356SKB7ETO7JGYVJ
5. Click "Actions" â†’ "Deactivate"
6. Then click "Delete" to permanently remove it

### 3. Create New Access Keys
1. Still in Security credentials tab
2. Click "Create access key"
3. Select "Command Line Interface (CLI)"
4. Create the key
5. **SAVE THE NEW KEYS SECURELY**

### 4. Remove Quarantine Policy
1. In IAM, go to vmenu-admin user
2. Click "Permissions" tab
3. Find "AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV3"
4. Click "X" to detach this policy

### 5. Update GitHub Secrets
1. Go to: https://github.com/gauravjetly/vmenu-production-1/settings/secrets/actions
2. Update these with your NEW credentials:
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: (new key)
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: (new secret)

### 6. Update Local AWS CLI
```bash
aws configure
# Enter new access key and secret
```

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **NEVER commit AWS credentials to Git**
2. **NEVER share credentials in files**
3. Always use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
4. Use environment variables locally
5. Consider using AWS IAM roles instead of keys

## Check for Unauthorized Usage
1. Go to AWS Billing: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/
2. Check for any unexpected charges
3. Review CloudTrail logs for unauthorized API calls
