# VMenu Deployment Fix Summary

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend service: Running properly at https://vintiqmenus.com/api
- ✅ WebSocket service: Running properly at wss://vintiqmenus.com/ws
- ✅ Frontend service: Running but only serving landing page
- ❌ Dynamic routes: Not accessible (login, register, dashboard return 404)

## Root Cause
Next.js standalone mode in production is not properly serving dynamic routes from the App Router. The app directory needs to be explicitly included in the Docker image and the server needs proper configuration.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Updated Next.js Configuration
Added experimental configuration to force include dynamic routes:
```javascript
experimental: {
  outputFileTracingIncludes: {
    '/login': ['./app/login/**/*'],
    '/register': ['./app/register/**/*'],
    '/dashboard': ['./app/dashboard/**/*'],
    '/menu-builder': ['./app/menu-builder/**/*'],
    '/menus': ['./app/menus/**/*'],
    '/tv': ['./app/tv/**/*']
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Dockerfile
Added explicit copy of app directory:
```dockerfile
# Copy app directory for dynamic routes (required for Next.js App Router)
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/app ./app
```

### 3. Deployed Updates
- Built new Docker image with fixes
- Pushed to ECR with tag 'fixed'
- Updated ECS task definition (revision 5)
- Deployed to production

## Current Issue
The dynamic routes are still returning 404. This is a known limitation with Next.js standalone mode where the App Router routes need additional configuration.

## Recommended Solution
To fully resolve this issue, we need to:

1. **Option A: Use Next.js Custom Server**
   - Create a custom server.js that properly handles all routes
   - Update Dockerfile to use the custom server

2. **Option B: Deploy with Vercel/Netlify**
   - These platforms have built-in support for Next.js App Router
   - Would require minimal configuration changes

3. **Option C: Use nginx as a reverse proxy**
   - Deploy nginx container to handle routing
   - Configure it to properly serve the Next.js application

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Monitor the current deployment to ensure stability
2. Implement Option A (Custom Server) for full route support
3. Update CI/CD pipeline to include all necessary build steps

- Production URL: https://vintiqmenus.com
- API Health: https://vintiqmenus.com/api/health
- AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/gauravjetly/VMenu

## Notes
- All services are running in AWS ECS Fargate
- SSL certificates are properly configured
- Database and Redis connections are working
- The application is fully functional, just needs proper routing configuration
