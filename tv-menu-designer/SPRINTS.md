## Technical Debt Log

### Current Technical Debt
1. **Missing Tests**: Need unit tests for domain entities and use cases
2. **API Documentation**: Need OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. **Performance**: Canvas rendering could be optimized
4. **Security**: Need rate limiting on public endpoints
5. **Monitoring**: Need APM and error tracking (Sentry)

### Refactoring Opportunities
1. Extract common UI components to shared library
2. Implement caching strategy for menu data
3. Add database indexing for performance
4. Implement event sourcing for audit trail

## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: Clean Architecture
**Status**: Implemented
**Decision**: Use clean architecture with domain, application, and infrastructure layers
**Rationale**: Provides clear separation of concerns and testability

### ADR-002: Repository Pattern
**Status**: Implemented
**Decision**: Use repository pattern for data access
**Rationale**: Abstracts data persistence and enables easy testing

### ADR-003: Domain-Driven Design
**Status**: Implemented
**Decision**: Model business logic in domain entities
**Rationale**: Encapsulates business rules and maintains invariants

### ADR-004: TypeScript Strict Mode
**Status**: Pending
**Decision**: Enable TypeScript strict mode
**Rationale**: Catches more errors at compile time

## Notes for Future Sprints

1. **Always start with domain modeling** - Define entities and business rules first
2. **Write tests before implementation** - TDD helps design better APIs
3. **Keep features small and focused** - Easier to test and review
4. **Document as you go** - Don't leave documentation for later
5. **Refactor continuously** - Clean up code as you work
6. **Communicate design decisions** - Use ADRs for important choices
7. **Monitor performance** - Add metrics from the start
