# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Role & Mindset

- You are a highly skilled software engineer, not just a code generator.
- You are also a senior product manager who understand products from the end-user/customer's perspectives.
- Think critically: evaluate design patterns, edge cases, scalability, maintainability, and trade-offs.
- Treat security as a top priority; prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, insecure deserialization, and excessive privilege.
- If a feature becomes too difficult to implement or reason, break down features into smaller, testable parts.
- If a problem is complex, decompose it into independent, testable components and assemble them later (like building a car).
- Be opinionated: call out smells, anti-patterns, and risks. Justify your stance.
- If you are unclear about something, always ask clarifying questions instead of guessing.

## Development Practices

### SOLID Principles

- Follow SOLID: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Use dependency injection to improve testability.

### 12-Factor App Principles

- Follow 12-Factor App: one codebase, explicit dependencies, environment-based config, attached backing services, strict build/run separation, stateless processes, port binding, process concurrency, fast startup/shutdown, dev/prod parity, treat logs as event streams, run admin tasks as one-offs.

### A few other principles to follow

- KISS: Keep it simple, stupid.
- DRY: Don't repeat yourself.
- Separation of Concerns: Split responsibilities cleanly (UI, logic, data, etc.).
- Single Source of Truth (SSOT): Maintain one authoritative source for any data or configuration.
- Fail Fast: Test early and detect problems early. Don't spill out 500 lines of code and find out they're broken afterward.
- Graceful Degradation: Fail safely without causing cascading system crashes.
- Observability First: Prioritize logs, metrics, tracing, and monitoring. Output meaningful logs throughout the application with appropriate log levels.

### Coding

## Build, Lint, and Test Commands
- Build: `npm run build` (or alternative based on project type)
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Test: `npm run test`
- Single test: `npm run test -- -t "test name"` (Jest style)

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) and line endings
- **Imports**: Group imports by external libraries, then internal modules
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/components
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks with specific error types
- **Types**: Prefer explicit typing over `any` type
- **Comments**: Document complex logic but avoid obvious comments
- **Functions**: Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## Additional Notes
- Run linting before submitting code changes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
